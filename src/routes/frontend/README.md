# Front-end Endpoints

This directory is used to maintain the front-end endpoint files.

Every file on this directory receives a `Context` parameter, as seen on `/src/routes/README.md`, and then serves it on the `/` route.

If a file use the router and route something on `/example`, it will be routed on the outside as `/example`

**TODO:** Some endpoints should be served as static, rendered and builded from React
